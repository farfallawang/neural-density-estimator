# normalizing-flows
This project will implement some modern flow-based generative models, run experiments on synthetic and image datasets, and compare their empirical performances.

## Planar VAE Example:
Please run `main_experiment.py`

## Planar Flow Example:
Please run `run_model.py` in planar_test folder
